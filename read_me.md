# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction (ML + API + Cloud)

A simple end-to-end machine learning project that predicts diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.  
I built this in Python, deployed with FastAPI and hosted on the cloud with Render.  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Model**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on health features (glucose, BMI, age, etc.).  
- **API**: FastAPI with endpoints to check health (`/health`) and make predictions (`/predict`).  
- **Cloud**: Deployed on [Render](https://render.com) for a public API URL.  
- **UI (Coming soon)**: Streamlit / Lovable frontend that calls the API.
